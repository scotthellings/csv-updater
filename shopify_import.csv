The EPA regulates the monitoring and testing of underground storage tanks (USTs), that were or are used to store petroleum or other hazardous substances, which could impact the environment and human health. Currently, there are over half a million registered underground storage tanks in the US alone. Many tanks installed prior to the mid-80s were composed of steel, which can corrode over time allowing for leakage into the surrounding groundwater and soil. 

The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), passed in 1984, required the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop regulations for the underground storage of motor fuels. The EPA requires owners and operators of USTs to maintain and clean up sites damaged by petroleum contamination.

SPEX CertiPrep provides standards designed to meet the testing requirements set up by the EPA and many individual state regulations for LUST and LUFT.",,,,"TRUE","[{""component"":""n-Decane"",""concentration"":""1,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""Pentane"",""cas"":""124-18-5""},{""component"":""n-Dodecane"",""concentration"":""1,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""Pentane"",""cas"":""112-40-3""},{""component"":""n-Eicosane"",""concentration"":""1,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""Pentane"",""cas"":""112-95-8""},{""component"":""n-Heptadecane"",""concentration"":""1,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""Pentane"",""cas"":""629-78-7""},{""component"":""n-Heptane"",""concentration"":""1,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""Pentane"",""cas"":""142-82-5""},{""component"":""n-Hexadecane"",""concentration"":""1,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""Pentane"",""cas"":""544-76-3""},{""component"":""n-Hexane"",""concentration"":""1,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""Pentane"",""cas"":""110-54-3""},{""component"":""n-Nonadecane"",""concentration"":""1,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""Pentane"",""cas"":""629-92-5""},{""component"":""n-Nonane"",""concentration"":""1,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""Pentane"",""cas"":""111-84-2""},{""component"":""n-Octacosane"",""concentration"":""1,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""Pentane"",""cas"":""630-02-4""},{""component"":""n-Octadecane"",""concentration"":""1,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""Pentane"",""cas"":""593-45-3""},{""component"":""n-Octane"",""concentration"":""1,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""Pentane"",""cas"":""111-65-9""},{""component"":""n-Pentacosane"",""concentration"":""1,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""Pentane"",""cas"":""629-99-2""},{""component"":""n-Pentadecane"",""concentration"":""1,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""Pentane"",""cas"":""629-62-9""},{""component"":""n-Pentatriacontane"",""concentration"":""1,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""Pentane"",""cas"":""630-07-9""},{""component"":""n-Tetradecane"",""concentration"":""1,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""Pentane"",""cas"":""629-59-4""},{""component"":""n-Tridecane"",""concentration"":""1,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""Pentane"",""cas"":""629-50-5""},{""component"":""n-Undecane"",""concentration"":""1,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""Pentane"",""cas"":""1120-21-4""}]","Ambient","36","TX-HC-18","1 mL","1","Ambient","Pentane","Multiple","Non-Hazardous","https://www.spexcertiprep.com/knowledge-base/files/Organic-Sample-CofA.pdf","https://www.spexcertiprep.com/MSDS/TX-HC-18.pdf"

While the legalization of cannabis for both medicinal and recreational purposes has been gaining speed, legislation and regulation has not necessarily kept pace. Out of a drive for self-regulation and significant consumer safety concerns, many producers and manufacturers are turning to testing labs in order to ensure that their products are of high quality and free of chemical contaminants.

SPEX CertiPrep offers ISO/IEC 17025 and ISO 17034 Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) for all of the common contaminants such as pesticide residues, residual solvents and heavy metals, as well as qualitative analysis CRMs, such as terpenes.

The EPA regulates the monitoring and testing of underground storage tanks (USTs), that were or are used to store petroleum or other hazardous substances, which could impact the environment and human health. Currently, there are over half a million registered underground storage tanks in the US alone. Many tanks installed prior to the mid-80s were composed of steel, which can corrode over time allowing for leakage into the surrounding groundwater and soil. 

The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), passed in 1984, required the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop regulations for the underground storage of motor fuels. The EPA requires owners and operators of USTs to maintain and clean up sites damaged by petroleum contamination.

While the legalization of cannabis for both medicinal and recreational purposes has been gaining speed, legislation and regulation has not necessarily kept pace. Out of a drive for self-regulation and significant consumer safety concerns, many producers and manufacturers are turning to testing labs in order to ensure that their products are of high quality and free of chemical contaminants. 

SPEX CertiPrep offers ISO/IEC 17025 and ISO 17034 Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) for all of the common contaminants such as pesticide residues, residual solvents and heavy metals, as well as qualitative analysis CRMs, such as terpenes. As the

The EPA is tasked with the monitoring of environmental systems as they pertain to contamination and human health. The methods issued by the EPA are created to respond to specific toxins or persistent organic pollutants (POPs) found in environmental samples such as soil, source water, drinking water, and waste. In particular, pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which were in widespread industrial use up until their restriction, are of concern due to their stable and persistent nature in the environment. Another group of chemicals of high concern is the hundreds of commercial pesticides and herbicides in use in the world today. Pesticides, from algaecides to virucides, are used in large quantities in industrial and private agriculture. The concern over human pesticide exposure over the past few decades has led to extensive monitoring of these pesticides. It has been reported that over 98% of insecticides and 95% of herbicides affect areas other than their intended target product. It is essential that monitoring agencies have accurate standard mixes to measure the pesticide levels in the environment. 

Many new pesticides are now being tested using highly sensitive LC/MS techniques, in addition to traditional GC techniques, to determine minute amounts of residue in environmental samples and food products. 

At SPEX CertiPrep, we facilitate ease of monitoring and testing of pesticides by creating pesticide test mixes to suit your monitoring needs. SPEX CertiPrep is the leader in offering pesticide standards designed to work within EPA, AOAC and FDA analytical testing methods using all of the leading analytical techniques: LC, LC/MS, GC, and GC/MS. Many pesticide standard mixes are readily available in our catalog along with a large list of single pesticide standards. In addition, custom pesticide mixes can be made to your specifications to create a mix that meets your needs.

Residual Solvent Single Standard

While the legalization of cannabis for both medicinal and recreational purposes has been gaining speed, legislation and regulation has not necessarily kept pace. Out of a drive for self-regulation and significant consumer safety concerns, many producers and manufacturers are turning to testing labs in order to ensure that their products are of high quality and free of chemical contaminants. 

SPEX CertiPrep offers ISO/IEC 17025 and ISO 17034 Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) for all of the common contaminants such as pesticide residues, residual solvents and heavy metals, as well as qualitative analysis CRMs, such as terpenes. As the

Analytical Standards for Medicinal and Recreational Cannabis Testing

While the legalization of cannabis for both medicinal and recreational purposes has been gaining speed, legislation and regulation has not necessarily kept pace. Out of a drive for self-regulation and significant consumer safety concerns, many producers and manufacturers are turning to testing labs in order to ensure that their products are of high quality and free of chemical contaminants.

SPEX CertiPrep offers ISO/IEC 17025 and ISO 17034 Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) for all of the common contaminants such as pesticide residues, residual solvents and heavy metals, as well as qualitative analysis CRMs, such as terpenes. As the industry demands change and regulations are put into place, we continually update our product offering.

The EPA regulates the monitoring and testing of underground storage tanks (USTs), that were or are used to store petroleum or other hazardous substances, which could impact the environment and human health. Currently, there are over half a million registered underground storage tanks in the US alone. Many tanks installed prior to the mid-80s were composed of steel, which can corrode over time allowing for leakage into the surrounding groundwater and soil. 

The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), passed in 1984, required the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop regulations for the underground storage of motor fuels. The EPA requires owners and operators of USTs to maintain and clean up sites damaged by petroleum contamination.

SPEX CertiPrep provides standards designed to meet the testing requirements set up by the EPA and many individual state regulations for LUST and LUFT.",,,,"TRUE","[{""component"":""n-Hexane"",""concentration"":""1,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""Methanol-P&T"",""cas"":""110-54-3""}]","Ambient","36","S-2190","1 mL","1","Ambient","Methanol-P&T","110-54-3","Non-Hazardous","https://www.spexcertiprep.com/knowledge-base/files/Organic-Sample-CofA.pdf","https://www.spexcertiprep.com/MSDS/S-2190.pdf"

Analytical Standards for Wine

Wine is a complex combination of water, alcohol and other substances such as organic acids, phenols, sugars, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. The chemical interactions of these compounds, combined with the aging process, determine the quality of the color, taste and aroma of the wine. However, during this process, the chemical interactions can also play key roles in spoiling the wine. For instance, cork taint transpires when naturally occurring airborne fungi are in the presence of chlorophenol compounds to form 2,4,6-trichloranisole (TCA) in the wine. When this occurs, the wine�s aroma is reduced significantly and is replaced by an undesirable smell and taste. 

To help regulate the spoilage of wine, the wine industry tests for several compounds that are known to cause this. For this industry, SPEX CertiPrep offers Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) for wine that are designed for GC, GC/MS, HPLC and LC/MS analysis. These standards are manufactured from the highest purity starting materials and the highest grade of solvents available in order to guarantee superior quality. Each standard is supplied with a detailed comprehensive Certificate of Analysis.",,,,"TRUE","[{""component"":""Ethanol"",""concentration"":""2,000 μg/mL"",""matrix"":""DI Water"",""cas"":""64-17-5""}]","Ambient","12","S-1885-W2K","1 mL","1","Ambient","DI Water","64-17-5","Non-Hazardous","https://www.spexcertiprep.com/knowledge-base/files/Organic-Sample-CofA.pdf","https://www.spexcertiprep.com/MSDS/S-1885-W2K.pdf"

The EPA regulates the monitoring and testing of underground storage tanks (USTs), that were or are used to store petroleum or other hazardous substances, which could impact the environment and human health. Currently, there are over half a million registered underground storage tanks in the US alone. Many tanks installed prior to the mid-80s were composed of steel, which can corrode over time allowing for leakage into the surrounding groundwater and soil. 

The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), passed in 1984, required the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop regulations for the underground storage of motor fuels. The EPA requires owners and operators of USTs to maintain and clean up sites damaged by petroleum contamination.

The EPA is tasked with the monitoring of environmental systems as they pertain to contamination and human health. The methods issued by the EPA are created to respond to specific toxins or persistent organic pollutants (POPs) found in environmental samples such as soil, source water, drinking water, and waste. In particular, pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which were in widespread industrial use up until their restriction, are of concern due to their stable and persistent nature in the environment. Another group of chemicals of high concern is the hundreds of commercial pesticides and herbicides in use in the world today. Pesticides, from algaecides to virucides, are used in large quantities in industrial and private agriculture. The concern over human pesticide exposure over the past few decades has led to extensive monitoring of these pesticides. It has been reported that over 98% of insecticides and 95% of herbicides affect areas other than their intended target product. It is essential that monitoring agencies have accurate standard mixes to measure the pesticide levels in the environment.

Many new pesticides are now being tested using highly sensitive LC/MS techniques, in addition to traditional GC techniques, to determine minute amounts of residue in environmental samples and food products. At SPEX CertiPrep, we facilitate ease of monitoring and testing of pesticides by creating pesticide test mixes to suit your monitoring needs. SPEX CertiPrep is the leader in offering pesticide standards designed to work within EPA, AOAC and FDA analytical testing methods using all of the leading analytical techniques: LC, LC/MS, GC, and GC/MS. Many pesticide standard mixes are readily available in our catalog along with a large list of single pesticide standards. In addition, custom pesticide mixes can be made to your specifications to create a mix that meets your needs.

The EPA is tasked with the monitoring of environmental systems as they pertain to contamination and human health. The methods issued by the EPA are created to respond to specific toxins or persistent organic pollutants (POPs) found in environmental samples such as soil, source water, drinking water, and waste. In particular, pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which were in widespread industrial use up until their restriction, are of concern due to their stable and persistent nature in the environment. Another group of chemicals of high concern is the hundreds of commercial pesticides and herbicides in use in the world today. Pesticides, from algaecides to virucides, are used in large quantities in industrial and private agriculture. The concern over human pesticide exposure over the past few decades has led to extensive monitoring of these pesticides. It has been reported that over 98% of insecticides and 95% of herbicides affect areas other than their intended target product. It is essential that monitoring agencies have accurate standard mixes to measure the pesticide levels in the environment.

Many new pesticides are now being tested using highly sensitive LC/MS techniques, in addition to traditional GC techniques, to determine minute amounts of residue in environmental samples and food products. At SPEX CertiPrep, we facilitate ease of monitoring and testing of pesticides by creating pesticide test mixes to suit your monitoring needs. SPEX CertiPrep is the leader in offering pesticide standards designed to work within EPA, AOAC and FDA analytical testing methods using all of the leading analytical techniques: LC, LC/MS, GC, and GC/MS. Many pesticide standard mixes are readily available in our catalog along with a large list of single pesticide standards. In addition, custom pesticide mixes can be made to your specifications to create a mix that meets your needs.

SPEX CertiPrep creates single and multi-component standards suitable for all HPLC detectors. Our standards are created in HPLC and LC/MS grade solvents to reduce potential interference and increase analytical accuracy.

High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is a column-based chromatographic technique used to separate components in a mixture for identification and quantification. A pump system passes pressurized mobile phase and sample through a pre-filled column containing a packing or sorbent which aids in the separation of component peaks. As each analyte in the mixture interacts with the column material, it retards the flow of the analytes within the column. HPLC can be used for identification and quantification of compounds in a variety of fields from agriculture to medical and manufacturing.

There are a multitude of various detectors commonly in use with a HPLC system including: Refractive Index Detector (RID), UV/Vis Detector, Photoiode Array Detector, and Mass Spectrometers.

The EPA regulates the monitoring and testing of underground storage tanks (USTs), that were or are used to store petroleum or other hazardous substances, which could impact the environment and human health. Currently, there are over half a million registered underground storage tanks in the US alone. Many tanks installed prior to the mid-80s were composed of steel, which can corrode over time allowing for leakage into the surrounding groundwater and soil. 

The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), passed in 1984, required the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop regulations for the underground storage of motor fuels. The EPA requires owners and operators of USTs to maintain and clean up sites damaged by petroleum contamination.

Analytical Standards for Medicinal and Recreational Cannabis Testing

While the legalization of cannabis for both medicinal and recreational purposes has been gaining speed, legislation and regulation has not necessarily kept pace. Out of a drive for self-regulation and significant consumer safety concerns, many producers and manufacturers are turning to testing labs in order to ensure that their products are of high quality and free of chemical contaminants.

SPEX CertiPrep offers ISO/IEC 17025 and ISO 17034 Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) for all of the common contaminants such as pesticide residues, residual solvents and heavy metals, as well as qualitative analysis CRMs, such as terpenes. As the industry demands change and regulations are put into place, we continually update our product offering.

The EPA regulates the monitoring and testing of underground storage tanks (USTs), that were or are used to store petroleum or other hazardous substances, which could impact the environment and human health. Currently, there are over half a million registered underground storage tanks in the US alone. Many tanks installed prior to the mid-80s were composed of steel, which can corrode over time allowing for leakage into the surrounding groundwater and soil. 

The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), passed in 1984, required the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop regulations for the underground storage of motor fuels. The EPA requires owners and operators of USTs to maintain and clean up sites damaged by petroleum contamination.

The EPA is tasked with the monitoring of environmental systems as they pertain to contamination and human health. The methods issued by the EPA are created to respond to specific toxins or persistent organic pollutants (POPs) found in environmental samples such as soil, source water, drinking water, and waste. In particular, pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which were in widespread industrial use up until their restriction, are of concern due to their stable and persistent nature in the environment. Another group of chemicals of high concern is the hundreds of commercial pesticides and herbicides in use in the world today. Pesticides, from algaecides to virucides, are used in large quantities in industrial and private agriculture. The concern over human pesticide exposure over the past few decades has led to extensive monitoring of these pesticides. It has been reported that over 98% of insecticides and 95% of herbicides affect areas other than their intended target product. It is essential that monitoring agencies have accurate standard mixes to measure the pesticide levels in the environment. 

Many new pesticides are now being tested using highly sensitive LC/MS techniques, in addition to traditional GC techniques, to determine minute amounts of residue in environmental samples and food products. 

At SPEX CertiPrep, we facilitate ease of monitoring and testing of pesticides by creating pesticide test mixes to suit your monitoring needs. SPEX CertiPrep is the leader in offering pesticide standards designed to work within EPA, AOAC and FDA analytical testing methods using all of the leading analytical techniques: LC, LC/MS, GC, and GC/MS. Many pesticide standard mixes are readily available in our catalog along with a large list of single pesticide standards. In addition, custom pesticide mixes can be made to your specifications to create a mix that meets your needs.

The EPA is tasked with the monitoring of environmental systems as they pertain to contamination and human health. The methods issued by the EPA are created to respond to specific toxins or persistent organic pollutants (POPs) found in environmental samples such as soil, source water, drinking water, and waste. In particular, pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which were in widespread industrial use up until their restriction, are of concern due to their stable and persistent nature in the environment. Another group of chemicals of high concern is the hundreds of commercial pesticides and herbicides in use in the world today. Pesticides, from algaecides to virucides, are used in large quantities in industrial and private agriculture. The concern over human pesticide exposure over the past few decades has led to extensive monitoring of these pesticides. It has been reported that over 98% of insecticides and 95% of herbicides affect areas other than their intended target product. It is essential that monitoring agencies have accurate standard mixes to measure the pesticide levels in the environment. 

Many new pesticides are now being tested using highly sensitive LC/MS techniques, in addition to traditional GC techniques, to determine minute amounts of residue in environmental samples and food products. 

At SPEX CertiPrep, we facilitate ease of monitoring and testing of pesticides by creating pesticide test mixes to suit your monitoring needs. SPEX CertiPrep is the leader in offering pesticide standards designed to work within EPA, AOAC and FDA analytical testing methods using all of the leading analytical techniques: LC, LC/MS, GC, and GC/MS. Many pesticide standard mixes are readily available in our catalog along with a large list of single pesticide standards. In addition, custom pesticide mixes can be made to your specifications to create a mix that meets your needs.

Pesticide Residues

While the legalization of cannabis for both medicinal and recreational purposes has been gaining speed, legislation and regulation has not necessarily kept pace. Out of a drive for self-regulation and significant consumer safety concerns, many producers and manufacturers are turning to testing labs in order to ensure that their products are of high quality and free of chemical contaminants. 

SPEX CertiPrep offers ISO/IEC 17025 and ISO 17034 Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) for all of the common contaminants such as pesticide residues, residual solvents and heavy metals, as well as qualitative analysis CRMs, such as terpenes. As the
industry demands change and regulations are put into place, we continually update our product offering.

Pesticide Residues

While the legalization of cannabis for both medicinal and recreational purposes has been gaining speed, legislation and regulation has not necessarily kept pace. Out of a drive for self-regulation and significant consumer safety concerns, many producers and manufacturers are turning to testing labs in order to ensure that their products are of high quality and free of chemical contaminants. 

SPEX CertiPrep offers ISO/IEC 17025 and ISO 17034 Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) for all of the common contaminants such as pesticide residues, residual solvents and heavy metals, as well as qualitative analysis CRMs, such as terpenes. As the
industry demands change and regulations are put into place, we continually update our product offering.

The EPA is tasked with the monitoring of environmental systems as they pertain to contamination and human health. The methods issued by the EPA are created to respond to specific toxins or persistent organic pollutants (POPs) found in environmental samples such as soil, source water, drinking water, and waste. In particular, pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which were in widespread industrial use up until their restriction, are of concern due to their stable and persistent nature in the environment. Another group of chemicals of high concern is the hundreds of commercial pesticides and herbicides in use in the world today. Pesticides, from algaecides to virucides, are used in large quantities in industrial and private agriculture. The concern over human pesticide exposure over the past few decades has led to extensive monitoring of these pesticides. It has been reported that over 98% of insecticides and 95% of herbicides affect areas other than their intended target product. It is essential that monitoring agencies have accurate standard mixes to measure the pesticide levels in the environment. 

Many new pesticides are now being tested using highly sensitive LC/MS techniques, in addition to traditional GC techniques, to determine minute amounts of residue in environmental samples and food products. 

At SPEX CertiPrep, we facilitate ease of monitoring and testing of pesticides by creating pesticide test mixes to suit your monitoring needs. SPEX CertiPrep is the leader in offering pesticide standards designed to work within EPA, AOAC and FDA analytical testing methods using all of the leading analytical techniques: LC, LC/MS, GC, and GC/MS. Many pesticide standard mixes are readily available in our catalog along with a large list of single pesticide standards. In addition, custom pesticide mixes can be made to your specifications to create a mix that meets your needs.

The EPA is tasked with the monitoring of environmental systems as they pertain to contamination and human health. The methods issued by the EPA are created to respond to specific toxins or persistent organic pollutants (POPs) found in environmental samples such as soil, source water, drinking water, and waste. In particular, pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which were in widespread industrial use up until their restriction, are of concern due to their stable and persistent nature in the environment. Another group of chemicals of high concern is the hundreds of commercial pesticides and herbicides in use in the world today. Pesticides, from algaecides to virucides, are used in large quantities in industrial and private agriculture. The concern over human pesticide exposure over the past few decades has led to extensive monitoring of these pesticides. It has been reported that over 98% of insecticides and 95% of herbicides affect areas other than their intended target product. It is essential that monitoring agencies have accurate standard mixes to measure the pesticide levels in the environment. 

Many new pesticides are now being tested using highly sensitive LC/MS techniques, in addition to traditional GC techniques, to determine minute amounts of residue in environmental samples and food products. 

At SPEX CertiPrep, we facilitate ease of monitoring and testing of pesticides by creating pesticide test mixes to suit your monitoring needs. SPEX CertiPrep is the leader in offering pesticide standards designed to work within EPA, AOAC and FDA analytical testing methods using all of the leading analytical techniques: LC, LC/MS, GC, and GC/MS.
